For this one I took a pretty simple approach for the task. 
Created an index.html which builds the structure of the page. 
Added ids and custom classes where necessary.
In the src.js file is all my JavaScript code which is very simply and imperatively written.
It helps to update the values dynamically when inputs or sliders are changed.
The styles.css contains all of my css. I tried to get as close as possible to the pictures in the document.
Not sure if intentional or not, but there were some mismatches when it comes to the text in the document and the pictures.
You will find a part of the html and the js commented out. I tried to get close to the presented pictures.
